just project for fun which is basically identical to what @ThePrimeagen did on stream. (but it's still raw)

'Ease vote' allowes you to write comments, modify, delete and search through database.

register/login is handled with jwt instead of twitch oauth like on stream.

just like the original one, comments are exclusive, meaning as an user you can post only 1 comment. 

app has like/dislike counts which sorts comments and showing the most liked ones first
