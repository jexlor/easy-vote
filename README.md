just project for fun which is basically identical functionally to what <a href="https://github.com/ThePrimeagen" target="_blank">ThePrimeagen</a> did on stream. (but it's still raw)

<strong>Ease vote</strong> allows you to write comments, modify, delete and search through database.

<strong>register/login</strong> is handled with <strong>jwt</strong> instead of twitch oauth like on stream.

just like the original one, comments are <strong>exclusive</strong>, meaning as an user you can post only 1 comment. 

app has <strong>like/dislike</strong> counts which sorts comments and shows the most liked ones first.

app is completely rendered on server, therefore it uses Templ library along with htmx to render front. <br> another difference is that <strong>Easy vote</strong> is powered by Golang on Echo framework (original is on php/laravel)

project is mostly for portfolio and is not meant to be used in production (even tho with slight modifications it can work there too without any problems)

Here's example of UI which is as simple as possible
<img width="1920" height="953" alt="screencapture-localhost-8080-v1-comments-2025-10-09-18_00_00" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f135940-c1ae-4863-b65a-7f55d5e010e4" />
